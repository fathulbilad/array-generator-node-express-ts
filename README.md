# Complex Random Data Generator API

## A lightweight API that generates random, deeply-nested JSON data — perfect for developers who need quick, realistic test data for JavaScript/TypeScript practice, prototyping, playgrounds, UI testing, recursion exercises, and more.

### This tool creates unpredictable combinations of primitives, arrays, and nested objects with controlled depth and size.

Features :
• Generates random:
• Numbers, strings, booleans
• Objects with dynamic keys
• Arrays with random lengths
• Fully recursive, nested structures
• Customizable size and maxDepth per request
• Environment variables for safety caps
• Fast and lightweight (Express.js)
• Perfect for playgrounds and code challenges
